# James “Jay” Burgess — Data & AI Engineer | Applied Data Science | Revenue Architecture

I design and ship data systems end-to-end:
ingestion → modeling → ML/AI → analytics → revenue and operational impact.

My work spans three connected lanes:

- **Data Engineering** – Building reliable, well-modeled, production-grade data pipelines.
- **Applied Data Science** – Turning that data into forecasts, scores, and insights that hold up under scrutiny.
- **Revenue & Decision Systems** – Mapping data and models directly to growth, retention, risk, and efficiency.

This GitHub is where I show how I think in code.

## Core Themes in My Work

### 1. Production-Minded Data & ML

Even in demo and academic projects, I optimize for:

- Clear, modular structure
- Reproducible pipelines
- Documented assumptions and metrics

Relevant repos:

- **StockSentimentAnalysis** – NLP + sentiment pipeline for equities, from raw text to trading signals.
- **Employee-Turnover-Prediction** – End-to-end churn modeling: cleaning, features, model training, evaluation.
- **brain-segmentation-modeling** – Deep learning workflow for MRI segmentation, focused on clarity and experiment structure.

Each project is built like a blueprint I’d harden for production.

### 2. Analytics That Explain Behavior

I care less about toy accuracy scores and more about:

- Who is likely to convert, churn, or succeed?
- Which segments matter?
- What variables actually drive outcomes?

Examples:

- **Pricing-Predictions-For-Diamonds** – Supervised learning + feature insights around pricing dynamics.
- **Iris-Dataset-Analysis** – Classic dataset, but structured to showcase clean EDA, modeling, and interpretation.
- Additional repos iterating on segmentation, classification, and forecasting patterns.

### 3. Revenue & Product Thinking

My background extends beyond models:
I use data to answer “where is the money and where is it leaking?” and
“how should systems be designed so leadership can act with confidence?”

You’ll increasingly see:

- Frameworks for funnel analytics, LTV, CAC, ROAS, retention.
- Prototypes that pair:
  - data models → dashboards → decisions (e.g., marketing allocation, risk flags, staffing, capacity).
- Code that treats revenue and operations as **systems**, not vibes.

See:

- **trsrevos** – Early work around Revuity/TRS revenue systems and automation patterns (being evolved into a more opinionated revenue architecture toolkit).

## Tech I Work With

**Languages**
- SQL • Python • PySpark • TypeScript

**Data & Platforms**
- Databricks • Snowflake • Postgres/Supabase • Delta/Lakehouse patterns

**ML & AI**
- scikit-learn • deep learning frameworks • NLP/sentiment
- LLM-based assistants and internal copilots for analytics & ops

**Analytics & Ops**
- dbt-style transformations • CI/CD for data • testing • documentation

I am bias toward tools and patterns that make systems observable, explainable, and maintainable.

## How to Read This GitHub (For Recruiters & Hiring Managers)

- Looking for **Data Engineer / Data Platform / Analytics Engineer**?
  - Check the repos with clear pipelines, transformations, and structure.
- Looking for **Applied Data Scientist / ML**?
  - Check the prediction, segmentation, and NLP projects with documented reasoning.
- Looking for someone who understands **revenue, growth, and operations**?
  - Look at how projects tie models and metrics back to business questions in their READMEs.

If you’re evaluating me:
assume these are templates of how I’d approach your environment—then scale, secure, and harden.
